Git commands (Udacity Lesson 2)

Branching

$ git checkout coins
$ git log   (top are most recent ones)
Tip : Exit git log —> press ‘q’ or ‘h’ for help

$ git checkout -b branch_name (if you want to retain commits)
equivalent to running two commands
$ git branch new_branch_name
$ git checkout new_branch_name

Merge 
$get merge branch1 branch2 

in case of conflict
1-  git merge —abort

2- git status 

$git show commit_id   ( show diff between commit and its parent)
$git branch -d branch_name ( delete label of the branch)


$ git log -n 1  ( show last commit only)
